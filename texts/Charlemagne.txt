Charlemagne, also known as Charles the Great, was King of the Franks and Lombards before becoming the first Holy Roman Emperor in 800. His reign is marked by the Carolingian Renaissance, a revival of art, culture, and learning based on classical models, which laid the foundations for medieval European civilization.
