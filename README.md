Last week, Microsoft's Azure AI team dropped **Florence-2** on Hugging Face. Let's play.

The model can handle a variety of vision tasks using a prompt-based representation. Should excel at tasks such as captioning, object detection, visual grounding and segmentation, performing on par or better than many large vision models out there. Comes in two sizes, with [Florence-2-large](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-large) at 771M as light as 2.88 GB finetuned for OCR.
